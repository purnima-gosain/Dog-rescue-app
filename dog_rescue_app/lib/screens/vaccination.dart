Between 6 and 8 weeks of age, pups begin their vaccine series, with boosters every 3 to 4 weeks until they reach the age of 20 weeks. A rabies vaccine is given at some point, usually around the age of 12 weeks or older. \n 3. Older puppies (over 16 weeks old) who have not yet had their first vaccine will require that vaccine as well as a booster in 3 to 4 weeks. At one of these appointments, the rabies vaccine is also administered. \n 4. Depending on your dog's risk factors, lyme, bordetella, and the canine flu vaccine may be suggested. The canine flu and Lyme vaccines, if administered, are boostered in 3â€“4 weeks to achieve protection, regardless of age. \n 5. The immunizations provided at each appointment will differ depending on the size of your dog, local legislation, and risk factors based on location and lifestyle. To decide your dog's yearly and lifelong immunization program, we recommend consulting with your veterinarian.",

The CPV vaccination is frequently given as part of a combination shot that contains the distemper, canine adenovirus, and parainfluenza vaccines, among others. From the time a puppy is 6 weeks old until he is at least 16 weeks old, these injections are given every 3 to 4 weeks.
